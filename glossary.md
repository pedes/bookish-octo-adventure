# Glossary

## A

### API (Application Programming Interface)
A set of rules and definitions that allow different software applications to communicate with each other. APIs define the methods and data formats that applications can use to request and exchange information.

### API Endpoint
A specific URL where an API can be accessed by a client application. Each endpoint corresponds to a specific function or resource provided by the API.

### Authentication
The process of verifying the identity of a user or application before allowing access to an API. Common methods include API keys, OAuth, and JWT (JSON Web Token).

## B

### Base URL
The root URL for an API, which remains constant across all endpoints. For example, in `https://api.example.com/v1/users`, `https://api.example.com/v1/` is the base URL.

## C

### Client
An application or system that accesses an API to request services or data from a server.

### CRUD Operations
The four basic functions of persistent storage: Create, Read, Update, and Delete.

## D

### Data Format
The structure in which data is transmitted between the client and the API. Common formats include JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) and XML (eXtensible Markup Language).

### Documentation
Comprehensive information about how to use an API, including endpoints, request/response formats, authentication methods, and examples.

## E

### Endpoint
See **API Endpoint**.

### Error Handling
The process of managing errors and exceptions that occur when making API requests. This includes defining error codes, messages, and possible resolutions.

## H

### HTTP Methods
The standard methods used to interact with resources via an API. Common methods include GET (retrieve data), POST (create data), PUT (update data), DELETE (remove data), and PATCH (partial update).

### HTTP Status Codes
Standard response codes given by servers indicating the result of a client's request. Examples include 200 (OK), 404 (Not Found), and 500 (Internal Server Error).

## J

### JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)
A lightweight data-interchange format that is easy for humans to read and write and easy for machines to parse and generate. Commonly used for API responses and requests.

## O

### OAuth
An open standard for access delegation, commonly used for token-based authentication. OAuth allows users to grant third-party applications access to their resources without sharing their credentials.

## P

### Pagination
A method of dividing large sets of data into discrete pages to make API responses more manageable and to reduce load times.

### Payload
The data sent by the client to the server in an API request. In a POST request, for example, the payload contains the data to be created or updated.

## R

### Rate Limiting
The process of controlling the number of requests an API can handle within a given time period to prevent abuse and ensure stability.

### REST (Representational State Transfer)
An architectural style for designing networked applications. RESTful APIs use standard HTTP methods and are stateless, meaning each request from a client contains all the information needed to process the request.

## S

### SDK (Software Development Kit)
A collection of software tools and libraries that developers use to create applications for a specific platform or framework. SDKs often include APIs, documentation, and sample code.

### Swagger
A framework for building APIs and a specification for documenting them. Swagger allows developers to design, build, document, and consume RESTful web services.

## T

### Throttling
A technique used to limit the number of API requests a client can make in a given time period. This helps to manage load and ensure fair usage of the API.

### Token
A piece of data that is used to authenticate or identify a user or application. Tokens are often used in place of traditional credentials like usernames and passwords.

## W

### Webhook
A method of augmenting or altering the behavior of a web page or application with custom callbacks. Webhooks are triggered by specific events and allow real-time communication between systems.

## X

### XML (eXtensible Markup Language)
A markup language that defines rules for encoding documents in a format that is both human-readable and machine-readable. XML is used for data interchange between systems and applications.
